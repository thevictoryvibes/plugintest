                <p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"><strong>Rome, Italy</strong> &#8211; The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) officially opened its first-ever global exhibition &#8220;From Seeds to Foods&#8221; on October 10, 2025, in Rome&#8217;s Park of Porta Capena, launching celebrations for the organization&#8217;s 80th anniversary of international cooperation in fighting world hunger.</p>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The four-day exhibition, running through October 13, transforms the historic Roman park into an immersive open-air gallery that traces the complete evolution of global agrifood systems from ancient agricultural practices to cutting-edge modern innovations. The free public exhibition welcomes visitors to experience humanity&#8217;s agricultural journey through interactive displays, cultural performances, and technological demonstrations.</p>
<h2 id="royal-support-and-international-participation" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Royal Support and International Participation</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The exhibition&#8217;s inauguration ceremony drew high-level international participation, led by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu and featuring distinguished guests including King Letsie III of Lesotho, Indonesia&#8217;s Minister for National Development Planning Rachmat Pambudy, and Italy&#8217;s Permanent Representative to UN Organizations in Rome, Ambassador Bruno Archi.</p>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">&#8220;This exhibition offers a unique platform for nations to showcase their agricultural heritage, achievements and aspirations,&#8221; said King Letsie III during the opening ceremony. &#8220;It tells the story of human survival, resilience and innovation.&#8221;</p>
<h2 id="immersive-journey-through-global-food-systems" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Immersive Journey Through Global Food Systems</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Visitors begin their journey at the &#8220;Introductory Pavilion – Where the Journey Begins,&#8221; then progress through six regional pavilions created by FAO&#8217;s Regional Offices, culminating in a culinary showcase called &#8220;Foods of the World&#8221;. The exhibition features both traditional agricultural methods and revolutionary technologies, including a replica of the Svalbard Seed Vault, hydroponics greenhouses, agricultural drones, satellite monitoring systems, and specially trained dogs that detect plant diseases.</p>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The exhibition&#8217;s &#8220;Main Stage&#8221; serves as a central hub for dialogue, exchange, and cultural celebrations throughout the event, hosting workshops, talks, cooking demonstrations, and performances celebrating agricultural heritage worldwide.</p>
<h2 id="cultural-programming-highlights-global-diversity" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Cultural Programming Highlights Global Diversity</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Cultural programming includes performances by Guatemalan artist Sara Curruchich, the main singer of the 2025 World Food Forum, culinary showcases by Italian Chef and FAO Food Hero Max Mariola, and performances by the Angklung Orchestra of Indonesia. These diverse cultural elements emphasize the global nature of agricultural heritage and food traditions.</p>
<h2 id="faos-eight-decades-of-global-impact" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">FAO&#8217;s Eight Decades of Global Impact</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The exhibition marks the official launch of FAO&#8217;s 80th anniversary celebrations, commemorating eight decades of international cooperation since the organization&#8217;s establishment as a specialized United Nations agency in 1945. Throughout its history, FAO has led international efforts to defeat hunger, improve nutrition, and enhance food security worldwide through technical assistance, policy development, capacity building, and international cooperation.</p>
<h2 id="the-four-betters-framework-guides-modern-mission" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">The Four Betters Framework Guides Modern Mission</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Central to FAO&#8217;s current work are &#8220;The Four Betters&#8221; &#8211; Better Production, Better Nutrition, a Better Environment, and a Better Life &#8211; which guide the organization&#8217;s Strategic Framework 2022-2031. This comprehensive approach addresses sustainable consumption patterns, resilient agrifood systems, climate change mitigation, and inclusive agricultural transformation.</p>
<h2 id="connection-to-world-food-day-2025" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Connection to World Food Day 2025</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The exhibition coincides with the fifth World Food Forum and precedes World Food Day 2025 on October 16, which carries the theme &#8220;Hand in Hand for Better Foods and a Better Future&#8221;. This theme emphasizes the critical importance of global collaboration in creating peaceful, sustainable, and food-secure societies while addressing contemporary challenges including climate change, conflicts, and food access inequalities.</p>
<h2 id="permanent-legacy-for-rome" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Permanent Legacy for Rome</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">Beyond its temporary programming, the exhibition includes a permanent &#8220;Monumental Tree Pathway&#8221; &#8211; a wooden walkway constructed from reclaimed pinewood designed to protect centuries-old tree roots &#8211; which will remain as a symbolic legacy donated to the City of Rome. This sustainable infrastructure element represents FAO&#8217;s commitment to environmental stewardship while providing lasting value to the local community.</p>
<h2 id="looking-forward-innovation-meets-tradition" class="mb-2 mt-4 font-display font-semimedium text-base first:mt-0 md:text-lg [hr+&amp;]:mt-4">Looking Forward: Innovation Meets Tradition</h2>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The &#8220;From Seeds to Foods&#8221; exhibition embodies FAO&#8217;s evolution from addressing post-World War II food shortages to tackling modern challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, and sustainable development. By showcasing innovative solutions that bridge traditional agricultural knowledge with cutting-edge technology, the exhibition demonstrates how international cooperation continues to drive progress toward global food security.</p>
<p class="my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2">The exhibition runs daily from 10 AM to 8 PM through October 13, 2025, with free admission for all visitors at Rome&#8217;s Park of Porta Capena. Additional information about the exhibition and FAO&#8217;s 80th anniversary celebrations is available through the organization&#8217;s official website and social media channels.</p>
